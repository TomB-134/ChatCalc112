# ChatCalc112
Adds an ingame calculator with some special functionality.

## Normal Calculator
For detailed instructions refer to the [original mod](https://github.com/jrddp/ChatCalc)

`3+3 -> TAB -> 6`

## Stack Calculator
Stolen from my 1.18 mod [StackCalc](https://github.com/TomB-134/StackCalc)

To use it, open chat and type your number and add "s" to the end of it (e.g 1234s) and then simply press the tab key.\
For larger numbers you can also type "sb" and that will calculate shulker boxes as well. For example "12345sb" will become "7 (Shulker Boxes) + 3 (Stacks) + 57 (Items)".\
There is also a double chest calculator if you care. Use it the same way "dc"

`1234s" -> TAB -> "19 (Stacks) + 18 (Items)`

`12345sb" -> TAB -> "7 (Shulker Boxes) + 3 (Stacks) + 57 (Items)`
